# Collaboration Folder Structure

This folder contains information about academic collaborators organized by researcher.

## Folder Structure

Each collaborator has their own folder with the following files:

```
Dr_[Name]_[Institution]/
├── photo.jpg or photo.png        # Researcher's photo (recommended: 400x400px or larger, square)
├── bio.txt                        # Detailed biography
├── institution_logo.png           # University/institution logo (recommended: transparent PNG)
└── info.txt                       # Quick reference information (name, title, email, etc.)
```
